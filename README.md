# Why

Modification based on this repo (Huge thanks btw)
https://github.com/bartolli/ollama-bearer-auth-caddy

The reason was that I want to use ollama natively inside the OS.
Therefore, Open Web UI -> Caddy (+validation api key) -> Ollama 

The objective is that I want to make Open Web UI as an API for accessing Ollama with different API Keys
